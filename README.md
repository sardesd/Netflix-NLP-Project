Netflix NLP Project
Dataset Comprehension
The dataset comprises various attributes, each providing distinct information about the content available on Netflix.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction
The data is preprocessed and features are extracted. For textual data, the Bag of Words (BoW) model is employed to convert the text into numerical vectors.

Dimensionality Reduction
The BoW model may result in high-dimensional data, which is challenging to manage and visualize. To address this, dimensionality reduction techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are utilized.

Clustering
Upon reducing the dimensionality of the data, the KMeans clustering algorithm is applied to partition the dataset into distinct clusters.

Visualization
A dendrogram is created to visualize the hierarchical relationship between clusters. Additionally, t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is used for visualization.

Interpretation
The final phase involves interpreting the results. This may include analyzing the characteristics of the different clusters, understanding the relationships between various movies and TV shows, and deriving insights into the content available on Netflix.

Variables Description
The dataset contains the following variables:

show_id: A unique identifier for each show.
type: The format of the show, typically classified as ‘Movie’ or ‘TV Show’.
title: The name of the show.
director: The person or group of people who directed the show.
cast: The actors and actresses who are part of the show.
country: The country where the show was produced.
date_added: The date when the show was added to the platform.
release_year: The year when the show was originally released.
rating: The rating given to the show, based on age suitability.
duration: The length of the show. For movies, it’s usually in minutes, and for TV shows, it’s usually in seasons.
listed_in: The genre or category of the show.
description: A brief summary of the show’s storyline.
Workflow
The workflow includes creating a bag of words, applying TF-IDF, performing SVD, creating a dendrogram, plotting an elbow plot, calculating the Silhouette Score, performing KMeans clustering, creating cluster word clouds, and generating a TSNE Plot.

Conclusion
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Netflix dataset using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The methodology involved understanding the dataset, preprocessing and feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, clustering, visualization, and interpretation. The clusters formed provided valuable insights into the content available on Netflix. However, there were limitations observed in silhouette scoring. The tsne plots for both movies and TV shows datasets indicated a reasonable structure has been found. Although the datasets were largely cleanly divided, there is room for improvement. Future work could focus on improving the clustering and visualization techniques.
